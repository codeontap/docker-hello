# Docs Support

This repo stores a collection of resources that we use to demonstrate concepts and hamlet features on the [hamlet docs](hamlet.io) site

## Contributing

1. Create a top level folder for each new component that you want to add
2. Provide a README.md file for each component outlining what it does
3. Update this README with a link to the component and a list of where the component is used in the docs site
